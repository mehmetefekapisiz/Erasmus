Hello,

Please find below a list of tasks for this semester from subject HCI:

1a. Simple "hello world" application in text mode.

1b. More complex text mode application https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode
Created using MVC pattern: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller

Like a library of books for example, or some cashier application to register products, a game etc.
For Java you can use Lanterna library: https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna
For C# you can use SpectreConsole library: https://spectreconsole.net

2. The same application, but in graphical windows mode (i.e. replace "view" module from above application). The best would be to allow user to switch between text mode and GUI mode of the application. In Java you can use AWT or Swing for this. For example, user should be able to log in and borrow a book using text mode application and then search for it using graphical user interface version of the application.

3. Create UX design, wireframes of more advanced application (approx. 10 screens) and navigation diagram. Can use Adobe XD, Figma, Cacoo

Note, you need to show these project during duration of the semester and present them personally. The deadline is end of semester.

Thanks,
Marcin Skoczylas, Ph.D.
